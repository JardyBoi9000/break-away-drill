# this app is a timing drill for calf roping but could probably help in other ways aswell in sports or other activities that require a sudden shift in whatever your doing.
# you choose a number and press start and that the program says random numbers untill it calls your number and that is when the roper should throw their rope. 
# it is very simple and does the job, i have also set in random intervals between the numbers being called to help break the cadence that a roper might find themself in.
# in the future i hope to make it look a litte better and perhaps give more ability to the user to play with how things are done allowning them to set the time between numbers said, how long you have to set up after pressing the start button, and perhaps how many numbers at minimum it needs to say before it says your number. i want to put all this in the hands of the user to change and sute their needs better.
